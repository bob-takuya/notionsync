## Features

- Git-like commands: `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `log`, `status`
- Auto-creation and management of `index.md`
- Mapping Markdown files to Notion pages
- Simple version history of Notion content
- Support for Notion databases
- Advanced Markdown formatting conversion (code blocks, quotes, etc.)
- Support for Notion child pages

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bob-takuya/notionsync.git
   cd notionsync
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Configuration

Before using NotionSync, you need to set up your Notion API credentials:

1. Create a Notion integration:
   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Click "New integration"
   - Enter a name (e.g., NotionSync)
   - Click "Submit"
   - Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (API key)

2. Share your Notion page with the integration:
   - Open your Notion page
   - Click the "Share" button
   - Select "Add people, emails, groups, or integrations"
   - Select your integration name
   - Click "Invite"

3. Run `notionsync init` in your project directory

4. Edit the created `.env` file:
   ```
   NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
   NOTION_PAGE_URL=https://www.notion.so/your_page_url
   # Uncomment the following line if using a database
   # NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
   ```

## Working with Child Pages

NotionSync supports working with Notion's hierarchical page structure. When you pull content from Notion, both the main page and its child pages will be retrieved:

- The main page content is saved to `index.md`
- Each child page is saved as a separate Markdown file
- The filename is derived from the page title

### Embedded Child Pages

Notion allows child pages to appear between paragraphs or other content. When you pull content from Notion, these embedded child pages will be represented in the Markdown as links to the corresponding child page file:

```markdown
This is content before the child page.

## Section Before

[ðŸ“„ Embedded Child Page](Embedded Child Page.md)

## Section After

This is content after the child page.
```

The child page itself will be saved as a separate Markdown file, just like any other child page:

```markdown
# Embedded Child Page

This is content inside the embedded child page.
```

When pushing content back to Notion, child pages will be created as separate pages under the parent page, with the file name (minus the `.md` extension) used as the page title.

### Example

A Notion workspace with this structure:
```
Main Page
â”œâ”€â”€ Child Page A
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Nested Page 1
â””â”€â”€ Child Page B
```

Will be pulled as:
```
index.md          # Contains Main Page content
Child Page A.md   # Contains Child Page A content
Nested Page 1.md  # Contains Nested Page 1 content
Child Page B.md   # Contains Child Page B content
```

### Creating Child Pages

Any Markdown file (other than `index.md`) in your workspace will be pushed to Notion as a child page of your main page. The filename (without the `.md` extension) will be used as the page title.

For example:
```
index.md          # Main page content
Project Plan.md   # Will become a child page titled "Project Plan"
Meeting Notes.md  # Will become a child page titled "Meeting Notes"
```

### Limitations

- Currently supports up to 5 levels of nested pages
- All child pages are saved as flat files in the root directory, regardless of their nesting in Notion
- Child database pages are detected but not fully supported yet

## Troubleshooting

- If you have issues with the API key or page URL, run a diagnostic:
  ```
  python -m notionsync.utils.api_test
  ```

- Common issues:
  - **"No accessible page found" error**: Check that your integration is properly shared with the page
  - **Page ID error**: Verify that your Notion page URL is correct
  - **Too many blocks**: Large Markdown files might exceed Notion's limit (will be automatically split)
  - **Missing child pages**: Ensure you're using the latest version that supports child pages

## Integration Tests

NotionSync implements test cases that use the actual Notion API. You can run the integration tests by following these steps:

1. **Create a Notion integration and obtain an API key:**
   - Visit [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Click on **"New integration"**
   - Enter a name (e.g., *NotionSync Test*)
   - Click **"Submit"**
   - Copy the **"Internal Integration Token"** (API key)

2. **Set the API key and page URL in the `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
   NOTION_PAGE_URL=https://www.notion.so/your_page_url
   # For database testing (if needed)
   # NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
   ```

3. **Open a test page on the Notion website and share it with your integration:**
   - Open the Notion page
   - Click the **"Share"** button in the top right corner
   - Select the integration and click **"Invite"**

4. **Run the integration tests:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/integration/test_notion_workflow.py -v
   ```

This will test the following use cases:

- Initial setup and automatic generation of `index.md`
- Local document creation and the status command
- Execution of the commit command
- Execution of the push command
- Pull command after editing on Notion
- Verification of the log command
- Re-editing flow after local edits
- Error handling and validation of improper operations
- Database integration tests (when `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` is set)

The tests create temporary directories for each step, which are automatically deleted upon completion.
